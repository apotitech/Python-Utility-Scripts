## Scripts

### car_cost_calculator.py

This script contains functions that help calculate various costs associated with owning and operating a car. These might include fuel costs, maintenance costs, and depreciation.

### fit_tracker.py

This script analyzes and displays data from a fitness tracker. It requires the `steps.txt` file to function correctly. The script reads the data from the text file and provides insights such as total steps, average steps per day, and other relevant metrics.

### hotdog.py

This script contains functions related to hotdogs. These could include calculating the number of hotdogs needed for a party, estimating the cost, or even nutritional information.

### paint_estimator.py

This script helps estimate the amount of paint required for a painting job. It includes functions to calculate the surface area to be painted and the amount of paint needed based on coverage rates.

## Text Files

### steps.txt

This text file contains data from a fitness tracker, which is used by the `fit_tracker.py` script to analyze and display fitness metrics.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
